# Decision Log

## Technical Decisions

### Initial Project Structure (2025-07-13)
Initialized the project with a modular, role-based architecture in Python.

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Project-wide

Rationale:
Established a foundation for scalable and maintainable development, with clear separation of concerns between different AI capabilities.

### Development Workflow (2025-07-13)
Established an initial development workflow using `git` for version control and a cycle-based approach for self-improvement.

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Development process

Rationale:
Ensures a consistent and trackable development process.

### Documentation Strategy (2025-07-13)
Implemented an automated documentation strategy using a memory bank to maintain project context and decision history.

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** Project documentation

Rationale:
Maintains an up-to-date and accessible record of the project's state and evolution.

### Patch Validation Enhancement (2025-07-13)
Added a `git apply --check` step to the `RefineRole` before applying any patch.

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** `RefineRole`, Engine Stability

Rationale:
Prevents the application of invalid or malformed patches, making the self-improvement cycle more robust and reducing the risk of a corrupted state.

Alternatives Considered:
- Relying solely on the `TestRole` to catch errors after application.

### Learning and Adaptation Framework (2025-07-14)
Implemented a `LearningLog` to record the outcome of every improvement cycle and integrated it into the `RefineRole` to provide examples in the patch generation prompt.

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** `RefineRole`, `Engine`, `SelfReviewRole`

Rationale:
Creates a feedback loop that allows the AI to learn from its past successes and failures, leading to more effective patch generation over time.

### Automated Test Generation (2025-07-14)
Enhanced the `TestRole` to automatically generate new `pytest` tests based on the code changes in the patch from the `RefineRole`.

**Status:** accepted
**Impact:** `TestRole`, Code Quality

Rationale:
Ensures that as the engine modifies its own code, it also expands its test suite, maintaining high code quality and preventing regressions.
