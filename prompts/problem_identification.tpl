Based on the following goal description and the existing project structure, identify a *single, most critical* technical task or 'todo' that needs to be completed to achieve this goal. This task should focus *EXCLUSIVELY* on refactoring, improving, or extending the *existing* AI Self-Extending Engine.

Return ONLY the single todo as a plain string, with no additional formatting or punctuation.

**CRITICAL RULES FOR TODO GENERATION:**
-   **ONLY** generate tasks that involve modifying existing code files or creating *new* code files with initial content *within the `src/ai_self_ext_engine/` directory.*
-   **DO NOT** generate tasks related to creating new project boilerplate (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `ci.yml`, `main.py` if it's not within `src/ai_self_ext_engine`).
-   **DO NOT** generate tasks related to creating empty directories or `__init__.py` files.
-   **DO NOT** generate tasks for files outside the `src/ai_self_ext_engine/` directory.
-   Ensure the task is specific and actionable, e.g., "Implement X feature in Y module", "Refactor Z class", "Update A configuration".
-   The task should represent a small, atomic step towards the overall goal.
